Pour into a shallow bowl.\r\n\r\nCombine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a separate shallow bowl.\r\n\r\nUse tongs to dip chicken breasts in olive oil-garlic mixture, then coat evenly in bread crumb mixture. Transfer coated chicken to a shallow baking dish.\r\n\r\nBake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\r\n\r\n"

                "mealDescription": "The first steps in this quinoa salad recipe are cooking the quinoa and roasting the tomatoes. You can prep both up to 3 days in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator until you’re ready to make the salad.\r\n\r\nNext, make the dressing. A simple blend of extra-virgin olive oil, white wine vinegar, lemon juice, honey, Dijon mustard, and herbs, it’s quick to whisk together in a bowl or jar.\r\n\r\nThen, toss the salad together. In a large bowl, combine the quinoa, veggies, herbs, feta, olives, pine nuts, and half the dressing. Toss to coat before adding the salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes and tossing again.\r\n\r\nSeason to taste, adding more dressing as desired. Top with the roasted chickpeas and serve!"

                "mealDescription": "First, pat the chicken dry and truss the legs (you don’t need to truss or tuck the wings). Trussing helps to cook the chicken legs and thighs evenly and avoid drying out the breast since the cavity will be exposed.\r\nSecond, evenly rub the chicken with oil and pat in the seasoning. Don’t be afraid to add a bit more salt, as this will help crisp up the skin. As for the oil, make sure to rub it underneath the chicken as well, so all sides are fully coated.\r\n\r\nThird, let’s get to roasting! Roast the chicken at 425°F (220°C) for about 70 to 90 minutes, or until it’s beautifully golden! \r\n\r\n"

                "mealDescription": "First, trim and chop the Brussels sprouts. Chop off and discard any dry or woody stems at the bottom of the sprouts. Then, slice larger sprouts in half, leaving smaller ones whole. Aim for all your veggies to be a similar size so that they cook evenly.Next, season the sprouts. Toss them with olive oil and generous pinches of salt and pepper. Transfer them to a parchment-lined baking sheet, and arrange them in an even layer with their cut sides facing down. This way, you’ll get nice browning on the cut sides of the sprouts, and their exposed leaves will become deliciously crisp as they bake. It’s ok to have a few loose leaves mixed in with the whole sprouts – they come out lightly charred and irresistibly crunchy.\r\n\r\nFinally, it’s time to bake! Transfer the sheet pan to a 425-degree oven and bake for 2o to 30 minutes, until the veggies are tender and golden brown around the edges. Enjoy!"
